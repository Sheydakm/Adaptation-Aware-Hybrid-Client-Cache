Cache-n-DASH
==================
A smart in network caching framework for DASH video streaming services. The aim is to evaluate a Cache prefetching scheme that improves the cache-hit and reduces unnecessary prefetches for the DASH segments. The prefetch scheme at the cache predicts the adaptation at the client end based on the bandwidth estimations made at the cache.
